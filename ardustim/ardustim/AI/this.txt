This is a project that simulates crank and cam angle wheel patterns for use with engine management systems
It uses mega2560 as microcontroller and outputs a defined pattern to two pins , crank and cam
simulating various patterns of teeth and cam pulses for different engine types and configurations

a wheel definition is specified in @wheel_defs.h and then iterated over to output the correct pattern to the two pins
